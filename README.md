# Basic RayLib with Web Build



## Lessons learned

- Raylib needs the PLATFORM set to Web for emscripten (Spent a bunch of time figure that out)
- Learned how to use CMakePresets with VSCode probably a good idea for cross compiled projects
- Emscripten in a subfolder (or maybe a sub module) in a good idea
